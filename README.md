HUE ROTATION is a lightweight web utility that generates and displays pure CSS code.
Each gradient is algorithmically crafted in real time, influenced by the user's input.

What you see is never the same twice and every gradient is stored only in your browser's session.
Once you leave, it’s gone.

HUE ROTATION is a space for anyone who needs a spark of visual inspiration.
It’s a quiet corner for generating ephemeral code you can use or let fade.
